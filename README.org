* Pipenvgraph
pipenvgraph is a small utility to draw the graph of depencies of a python virtual (pipenv) installation

** Requirements
 This module requires `pipenv` and `graphviz`.

** What does it do ?
  Then It simply run `pipenv graph` and parse the output into a graph '.gv' file sent to graphviz to produce an visual representation of the dependencies graphe of your pipenv installation.

** Usage
 Clone the repository
 Check the code. It's very small

 On the command ligne from within the virtual env you which to inspect run
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash  
 pipenvgraph -o png -f mygraph 
 #+END_SRC

 This will produce a mygraph.png file in your local folder.
 I hope it will not be as messing as this one:

 [[file:pipenvgraph.png]]

** Remerciements
 To irc, stackoverflow, coursera and Edx for helping me get up to speed in python.
