* Pipenvgraph
pipenvgraph is a small utility to draw the graph of depencies of a python virtual (pipenv) installation

** Requirements
 This module requires /pipenv/ and /graphviz/.

** What does it do ?
  Then It simply run /pipenv graph/ and parse the output into a graph /.gv/ file sent to /graphviz/ to produce an visual representation of the dependencies graph of your pipenv installation.

** Usage
 Clone the repository
 Check the code. It's very small

 On the command ligne and from within the virtual env you which to inspect run
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash  
python path/to/pipenvgraph -o png -f mygraph 
 #+END_SRC

 This will produce a /mygraph.png/ file in your local folder.
 I hope it will not be as messy as the one below:

 [[file:pipenvgraph.png]]

but it should give you an overview of your packages and dependencies

** Remerciements
 To irc, stackoverflow, coursera and Edx for helping me get up to speed in python.
